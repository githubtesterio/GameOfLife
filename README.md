# Game of Life Game

The Game of Life is not your typical computer game. It is a cellular automaton, and was invented by Cambridge mathematician John Conway. It consists of a grid of cells which, based on a few mathematical rules, can live, die or multiply. Depending on the initial conditions, the cells form various patterns throughout the course of the game.

## Rules
For a space that is populated:

- Each cell with one or no neighbors dies, as if by solitude.
- Each cell with four or more neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
- Each cell with two or three neighbors survives.

For a space that is empty or unpopulated:

- Each cell with three neighbors becomes populated.
